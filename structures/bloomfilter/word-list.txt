The
Old
Man
and
the
Sea
is
one
of
Hemingwayâ€™s
most
enduring
works
and
may
very
well
become
one
of
the
true
classics
of
this
generation
It
played
a
great
part
in
his
winning
the
Pulizer
Prize
in
1953
and
the
1954
Novel
Prize
for
Literature
and
confirmed
his
power
and
presence
in
the
literary
world
Hemingway
is
also
one
of
my
favorite
writers
Besides
The
Old
Man
And
the
Sea,
I
have
read
some
of
his
other
works,
such
as
The
Sun
Also
Rises,
A
Farewell
to
Arms
and
The
Snow
of
Kilimanijaro
But
The
Old
Man
and
the
Sea
is
the
one
that
left
the
deepest
impression
on
me
This
novel
mainly
wrote
one
old
person
alone
in
marine
fishes
He
fished
one
big
fish,
tied
up
the
fish
head
and
the
upper
part
of
the
body
side
the
boat
above
But
he
met
the
shark
fish,
the
old
person
causes
all
one's
skill
and
the
shark
fish
fight,
the
shark
fish
the
fish
flesh
which
could
eat
all
eats
finished
also
has
about
800
pounds
This
book
promulgates
the
truth,
not
showed
the
person
how
regardless
of,
most
feared
is
does
not
have
the
confidence
The
confidence
is
just
like
is
the
automobile
motor,
is
power
which
the
person
goes
forward
I
first
read
this
book
when
I
was
in
my
fifteens
And
now
I
remember
it
just
as
well
as
if
I
had
read
it
yesterday
